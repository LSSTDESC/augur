# Augur

Augur is a DESC forecasting and inference validation tool. The name comes from the official diviners in ancient Rome whose function was to divine whether the gods approved of a proposed undertaking by observing the behaviour of birds. Firecrown is the bird species of choice in DESC.

Augur is a wrapper to firecrown that generates synthetic datasets of abitrary complexity and then calls inference engine to either generate full MCMC or a simple second-order derivative at fiducal model to generate a Fisher matrix forecast.
